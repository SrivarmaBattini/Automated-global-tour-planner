# ✈️🌍 Automated Global Tour Planner

A smart Python-based desktop application that generates optimized multi-country travel itineraries based on user preferences such as interests, duration, budget, and starting location. The system uses heuristic search (TSP via Nearest Neighbor) and interest-matching logic to deliver a personalized travel plan and an interactive route map.

## 📌 About The Project

Planning a multi-country international trip is complex due to constraints like budget, time, and personal preferences. Manually optimizing the itinerary is time-consuming and often inefficient.

The **Automated Global Tour Planner** applies core AI techniques to solve this problem:
- Heuristic routing (Nearest Neighbor TSP)
- Constraint satisfaction (budget, time, preferences)
- Interest-based filtering
- Personalized planning logic

This tool provides an intuitive GUI to collect inputs and outputs a complete travel plan with dates, costs, and routes — all visualized on an interactive map.
